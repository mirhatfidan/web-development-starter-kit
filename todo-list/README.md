## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was created to practice and demonstrate:

- **JavaScript CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **DOM Manipulation** - Adding/removing HTML elements dynamically
- **Event Handling** - Click events and form submissions
- **Local Storage** - Persisting data in the browser
- **Array Methods** - Filter, map, forEach operations
- **ES6 Features** - Arrow functions, template literals
- **User Input Handling** - Form validation and processing
- **State Management** - Managing application state

## 🎨 Application Features

- **Add New Task** - Input field for creating tasks
- **Task List** - Display all current tasks
- **Complete Toggle** - Mark tasks as done/undone
- **Delete Button** - Remove individual tasks
- **Clear All** - Option to clear completed tasks
- **Persistent Storage** - Tasks saved in browser

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Add Task**: User enters task text and submits
2. **Display**: Task is added to the list and displayed
3. **Toggle Complete**: Click to mark task as complete
4. **Delete**: Remove task from list
5. **Save**: All changes are saved to local storage
6. **Load**: Tasks are loaded when page is refreshed

## 📦 Key JavaScript Concepts

- **DOM Selectors** - querySelector, getElementById
- **Event Listeners** - addEventListener for user interactions
- **Local Storage** - setItem, getItem, removeItem
- **Array Manipulation** - push, splice, filter
- **Dynamic HTML** - Creating elements with JavaScript
- **JSON** - Parse and stringify for storage
