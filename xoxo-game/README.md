## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was created to practice and demonstrate:

- **Game Logic** - Implementing win conditions and game rules
- **JavaScript Arrays** - Managing game board state
- **Conditional Statements** - Checking win/draw conditions
- **DOM Manipulation** - Updating game board dynamically
- **Event Handling** - Click events for player moves
- **Functions** - Organizing game functionality
- **State Management** - Tracking game state and turns
- **Algorithm Design** - Win detection algorithms

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start Game** - Player X starts first
2. **Take Turns** - Click an empty square to place your mark
3. **Win** - Get three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
4. **Draw** - If all squares are filled with no winner
5. **Reset** - Click reset button to start a new game

## 🎨 Game Features

- **3x3 Grid** - Classic Tic-Tac-Toe board
- **Player Turns** - Alternating X and O marks
- **Win Conditions** - 8 possible winning combinations
